    <h1>Errors</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is missing meta in the head. It helps initialize the page.</li>
        <li>I added lang to html because it was missing and the W3 validator recomends including it.</li>
        <li>There is a missing closing tag for item 3. I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated.</li>
        <li>There is missing closing tag for the paragraph. I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated. </li>
        <li>There is a missing closing tag for cell 3.I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated.</li>
        <li>There is a missing closing tag for 2nd row in the table. I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated.</li>
        <li>There is a missing closing tag for table. I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated.</li>
        <li>There is an improper path to image.png. I added the proper path within the folder because otherwise the image would not show up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>

        <li>There is a missing closing tag for h6, history. I added it in because otherwise the code will not be formatted properly and will not be validated.</li>
        <li>There is a missing link in href (where do I go), no spaces allowed in href. I added the proper link.</li>
        <li>I changed the heading numbers to make more sense. So the page is layed out properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I added doctype html, so the page validates.</li>
